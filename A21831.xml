         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Contrary to which Act of Parliament, one <hi>William Marſden,</hi> and <hi>Robert Anderton,</hi> Seminarie Prieſtes, being reconciled at <hi>Doüay in Artois,</hi> by a Ieſuite called Father <hi>Columbine,</hi> and made Prieſtes by the <hi>Cardinal of Guyſe</hi> at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving ſecretly out of Fraunce lately at the Iſle of Wight, where they were apprehended, haue confeſſed their purpoſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Realme, to haue bene to winne ſoules, (as they terme it) being in effect (as is before mentioned) to perſwade her Maieſties Subiectes vnder colour of maintenance of Popery, to Rebellion. For the which, they having bene by the due and orderly courſe of her Maieſties Lawes, tried &amp; convicted at the laſt Aſſiſes holden at Wincheſter in the Countie of Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, upon the Statute aforeſayde, were neuertheles by the Iudges of that Circuitc (knowing the mercifull minde and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpoſition of the Queenes Maieſtie to wardes all her Subiects:) conferred withall concerning their meaning to wards her Maieſties perſon and the Realme, at which time they pretended in wordes and exterior ſhew to acknowledge her Maieſtie to be rightfull Queene of this Realme, and to dowe and proteſt that they would at all times aduenture their lives in defence of her Maieſtie and her Realmes, againſt the Pope or any forraine power whatſocuer that ſhould attempt to inuade the Realme with force, and that they would not meddly or perſwade with any in matter of Religion, but onely keepe their owne conſciences to themſclues: Whereupon they were ſtayed from their execution, her Maieſties minding nothing leſſe, then that any of her Subiects, though diſagreeing from her in Religion, ſhould dye for the ſame, as by them and their companions hath bene moſt falſely and ſtanderouſly publiſhed and affirmed. Upon report whereof made by the ſayd Iudges to the Lords and others of her Maieſties moſt honorable Priuie Counſell, they folowing the milde and temperate courſe of her Maieſties government, cauſed the ſayd <hi>Marſden</hi> and <hi>Anderton</hi> to be ſtayed from exceution, and to be remooucd from Wincheſter to London, where they were furder conferred withall, and examined concerning their obedience and duetie towards her Maieſtie for Civill cauſes, onely to prooue whether they would remaine conſtant in their proteſtations in that behalfe made to the Iudges at their arraignement and conviction, that her Maieſtie might thereupon haue bene moved to extend her mercy towardes them. The ſayd <hi>Marſden</hi> and <hi>Anderton</hi> being accordingly examined by two principall perſons thereunto appoynted by her Maieſties ſayd priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and put in remembrance of their former ſhewe of dutie made before the Iuſtices of Aſſiſe, and adviſed to confirme the hope conceaved of their reformation in matters of their alleageance to her Maieſtie, to the ende they might thereby mooue her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie to ſhew mercy unto them: Whereupon firſt the ſayd <hi>Anderton</hi> being required to explane his true meaning in his proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Maieſties right to the Crowne, and of his alleageance, and particularly whether he did acknowledge her Maieſtie to be lawfull Queene, notwithſtanding any ſentence which the Pope either had giuen, or could giue againſt her: and whether he meant that it was his duetie, and the dueties of all her Maieſties Subjects, to withſtand the Pope, not onely if his inuaſion were for temporall reſpects, as to make conqueſt of the Realme, but alſo if he would attempt ſuch an inuaſion by force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Realme to his obedience by colour of Religion: he anſwered, that they be queſtions wherewith he doeth not deale, and required to be reſpited for his anſwere, vntil ſuch caſes ſhould happen, adding by way of abuſion, that in the meane time he may poſſibly be a Proteſtant, and ſo then become of other opinion then he is now of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Marſden</hi> to the ſame queſtions before propounded to <hi>Anderton,</hi> auſwered, <hi>That he acknowledged her Maieſtie to bee lawfull Queene of this Realme, and of other her Dominions: and that he tooke himſelfe bounde to obey her Maieſtie, ſo farre as his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience impeached no this duetie to God and to the Church, (meaning the Church of Rome) requiring that he might not be asked his opinion any furder, untill ſuch caſe of ſentence given by the Pope ſhould happen: and furder ſayth, that in caſe the Pope would ſend any forces into the Realme, to reduce the ſame to the Catholique Religion, (meaning Poperie) he would then do the duetie of a Prieſt, that is, he would pray, that right might take place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas they had both promiſed before the Iuſties of Aſſiſe, that they woulde not meddle in perſwading of any perſon in matter of Religion, but only keepe their owne couſcience to themſclues: they now in this examination denie that euer they promiſed not to deale with her Maieſties Subiectes, to perſwade them in matter of Religion: <hi>Anderton</hi> ſaying, <hi>That he taketh ſuch as be out of the vnitie of the Church of Rome, to ſtand in ſtate of damnation, and that therefore he is bounde in conſcience to doe what he can to reclaime them.</hi> And <hi>Marſden</hi> ſayth, <hi>He may not promiſe not to deale with any of her Maieſties Subiectes in matters of Religion: for that he comming into the Realme to perſwade the Catholique Religion, (meaning Poperie) he can not binde himſelfe not to doe that duetie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby may appeare to all her Maieſties loving and true hearted Subiects, the traiterous purpoſe of theſe two Seminary Prieſtes, being borne Subiects of the Realme, who though in generall termes and ſpeaches they ſeemed and made ſhew to the Iuſtices of Aſſiſe, of true and dutifull alleageance to the Queenes Maieſtie their naturall Soueraigne: yet when endeuour is vſed to vncover their maſked and ſayned proteſtations, they can not hide their malice and treaſonable intentions, even to their owne confuſions: which appearing thus manifeſtly to the Queenes moſt excellent Maieſtie, hauing ſubſcribed theſe former anſweres with their owne handes, whereas ſhe was much inclined vpon the report of the ſayd Iuſtices to afford them grace and pardon, if they would haue perſiſted in their former proteſtations, finding them nowe vnworthy thereof, hath left them to the puniſhment appoynted by the Law to be inflicted vpon them for their iuſt offence.</p>
